Tetris project is not designed/coded by me. It's based on an example wxWdigets code. 
Long time a go, once I coded an automatic tetris player. The code for that project is
quite old, it was coded in Borland C++. One day, I will integrate automatic tetris player into this project
and refine the user interface.

The other two projects (XOX and Eightnumber projects) are designed and coded by me. They are not finished yet
but they can be playable. Eightnumber project has an auto solver using different tree search thecniques. I will 
integrate a more smart automated XOX player soon.
